# Browser Games for Kicks

Property of Andrew Bell.

Will probably not work great on mobile.

## Things I want to make here:

1. Floppyfowl - flappy bird clone
2. Galaxy Attackers - Not at all related to space invaders
3. Meteroids - Can you guess the inspiration?
4. Hundenwald - A proud Wolfenstein 3D clone using WebGL
5. Paint Canvas - A paint clone

## To run:

`go build -o app.exe && app.exe` to walk around annoying Windows firewall messages

## TODO:

- Need run script
