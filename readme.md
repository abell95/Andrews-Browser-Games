# Browser Games for Kicks

Property of myself, the mighty and indomitable Andrew Bell.

Will probably not work great on mobile.

## Things I want to make here:

1. Floppyfowl - flappy bird clone
2. Galaxy Attackers - Not at all related to space invaders
3. Meteroids - Can you guess the inspiration?
4. Hundenwald - A proud Wolfenstein 3D clone using WebGL
